# CH485---Artificial-Intelligence-and-Chemistry
**Lecturer: Prof. Woo Youn Kim,  TA: Jaechang Lim**  
* AI has become a big social issue as it spreads rapidly to science, industry, and even daily life. Deep
learning techniques has attracted great attention as a new powerful tool for chemical research. In this course, we will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in modern chemistry and look at the latest trends in this
field. It aims to learn practical knowledge that can be used in actual research field through theory and
practice focused on deep learning.
* This is the repository for materials of KAIST 2019 fall Artificial Intelligence and Chemistry.  
* We use Google colab for all practices.
